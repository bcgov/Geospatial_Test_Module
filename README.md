# Geospatial Test Module

A test module to test the functionality of the Geospatial VDI python environment. 

The module will be able to:
- Test that important python libraries are available and able to import. (geobc.py, geopandas, pandas, etc...)
- Test select functions of each library as needed, especially for functions that have failed in the past.
- Etc...

The module will be able to run on a schedule and email interested parties when there are issues within the environment.
